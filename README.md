# Rubik Cube Mixing Time

Used to keep track of Rubik. Cube Goals, add important things for writeup

* Metric for measuring randomness of output cube
* Different algorithm, random axis, non-random 'h', 'w', 'l'
* Visualization of randomness over time

## Random Walk (Even Chance) movements

If every turn has a equal probability of occuring (might need to incorporate backwards/forwards), and we assume the stationary distribution is achieved after adequate time has passed, than we can assume the stationary distribution for the rubic cube for this is equal in every state.
